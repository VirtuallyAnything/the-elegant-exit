The Elegant Exit puts players in the role of a gay couple attending a large and overcrowded
birthday party for a distant acquaintance. It seems that they have only been invited to meet a
small quota of 'weird' people, as everyone else at the party is utterly boring. But with enough
free food and drink, it's bearable - until the birthday girl announces that she's prepared a
karaoke machine for later and wants everyone to sing.
It is time for an Elegant Exit - That means exiting the party as quickly as possible but leaving good
impressions all along the way, not stepping on any feet or ruffling any feathers - gracefully
gliding over the thin ice that is social expectations.

This game was created as part of the Game Design Course at Stuttgart Media University in the summer term of 2024 and development continued here afterwards.
